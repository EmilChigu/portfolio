# NextJS personal portfolio
A repo of my portfolio site i made with NextJS showcasing some of the project that i have worked on and are currently working on. Feel free to use the template with credits.

## Lessons learnt
Being familiar with ReactJS i wanted to try a simple front end project using NextJS. he main reason for choosing NextJS was the search engine optimisation that it allows unlike react. i also wanted to practise using its routing system and its components such as the Image and Link tags. finally i tackled implementing light and dark mode, the state hook and conditional rendering made the process a breeze.

## Features
- NextJS app
- Tailwind CSS
- useState hook
- Light and darkmode toggle

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
